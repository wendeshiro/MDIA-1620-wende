**Three “aha” moments**
- I learned how to use dir, cd, cd.., and clear commands in the terminal.
- I learned how to read version numbers.
- We should interact with computers logically.

**Two things that are still unclear** ( :relaxed: I got the answers during the class Q&A session. )
- How to directly access deeper folders in the terminal.
- How to delete folders or files in the terminal.

**One word for how I am feeling**
- Curious
