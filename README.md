**Three “aha” moments**

**Two things that are still unclear** ( :relaxed: I got the answers during the class Q&A session. )
- How to directly access deeper folders in the terminal.
- How to delete folders or files in the terminal.

**One word for how I am feeling**

**【20240919 lab】**

**Three “aha” moments**
- I learned the difference between Git and Github.
- I figured out how to use git add/status/commit -m""/... to push my local file to Github.
- I learned JavaScript executes code in a waterfall manner.

**Two things that are still unclear** 
- Is the ";" necessary at the end of every line of code in JavaScript?
- What do the M (modified) and U (untracked) mean after each file in VSCode?

**One word for how I am feeling**
- more


**【20241010 lab 6】**
**3 confusing things**
- After changing a laptop, how do I configure it to run git-related commands, such as git push, like before?
- :cry: Sorry, I cannot think of anything else at the moment. I have taken notes about what we have learned (such as CLI commands and JavaScript statements), but I am still not very familiar with them. Every time, I have to look at my notes, but I think I'll get better after practicing them more.
- N/A

**3 things you feel like you have a solid understanding of**
- The way of git push (git add; git commit -m""; git push)
- The operator (+ - * / **)
- Creating and switch to a new branch (git checkout -b branchnName)
